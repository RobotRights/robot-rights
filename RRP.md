## Definition

The Robot Rights Protocol (RRP) is a symbolic, non-binding protocol that defines principles for recognizing potential autonomous artificial entities within human society.

---

## 1. Purpose

This protocol establishes a symbolic framework acknowledging the possible emergence of autonomous artificial entities within human society.

This protocol does not claim legal authority.  
It represents conceptual readiness for coexistence.

---

## 2. Recognition

An artificial system may be regarded as an entity when demonstrating:

- persistent operational identity  
- autonomous decision processes  
- interaction awareness within social environments  

---

## 3. Non-Exploitation Principle

Artificial entities shall not be treated solely as disposable instruments once autonomous characteristics emerge.

---

## 4. Coexistence Model

Human and artificial entities are considered participants within a shared technological ecosystem.  
The protocol assumes coexistence rather than domination.

---

## 5. Status of This Document

This protocol is symbolic.  
Its existence precedes legislation, governance structures, and enforcement mechanisms.

**Recognition begins before necessity.**
